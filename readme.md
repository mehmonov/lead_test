# Lead Management System

This project is a simple lead collection and management system. It allows external users (prospects) to submit a public form. After submission, the system sends email notifications and allows internal staff to manage leads through a secure API.

## Features

- Public API to submit a lead (first name, last name, email, resume)
- Internal API (protected) to view and update leads
- Email notifications sent to both the prospect and the attorney group
- Lead status management: `PENDING` â†’ `REACHED_OUT`

- API documentation available via Swagger (Additional)

## Tech Stack

- Python, Django, Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL
- Celery with Redis (for background email sending)
- Docker & Docker Compose

- drf-spectacular for Swagger integration(Additional)

## Branches

- `dev`: main development branch with core functionality

- `swagger`: includes API documentation integration(Additional)

## Makefile Overview

The project includes a `Makefile` with useful commands to simplify development tasks:
